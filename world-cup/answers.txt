Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: A small number of simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: Seems the prediction stabilized after 1000 simulations but I would run the program for 10000 simulations for better accuracy and not much time cost also.
